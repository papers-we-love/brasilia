## Motivation
DevOps comprises a set of practices and cultural values that aims to reduce the barriers between development and operation teams. Among its benefits include improvement in operational efficiency, better business alignment between development and operations teams. Therefore, DevOps adoption is still a challenging task as it's unclear how to leverage the plethora of practices, tools, and information in a systematic way. Likewise, many works have focused on characterizing DevOps instead of providing recommendations to assist DevOps adoption. As a result, many questions remain open such as (a) is there any recommended path to adopt DevOps? (b) what is the relevance of each existing elements when embracing DevOps? and (c) what role play measurement, sharing, and automation in DevOps adoption?

## Proposal

This paper proposes a DevOps adoption model based on practitioners' viewpoint. The relevance of the proposed model was evaluated in a real case study. 

## Methodology

The paper relies on (a) **Goals/Questions/Metrics (GQM)** to both characterize DevOps adoption and to assess the performance of the model, (b) **grounded theory** as the research method to build an explanation about how DevOps has be successfully adopted in companies that claims to have made it, and (c) **focus group** method to explore a real experience, including the adoption of the proposed model. 

## Results

* A **collaborative culture** and not automation or tooling is the main enabler of DevOps. The main reasons are:
  - it breaks the silos between teams
  - it enables team collaboration tasks from the first day
  - it empowers teams to execute different tasks
  - it creates on teams a product thinking mindset. They seem a software as a product that does not end after pushing its code to a repository nor when it is received for publication
  - it enables a blameless environment. Teams focus on problem solving instead of witch-hunt mindset
  - Team embrace a shared responsibility working strategy

## Why do I care?

  - Automation seems to be insufficient to enable a DevOps culture. In some cases, it may be even a trap.
  - DevOps can be seen as a relationship between agility, automation, collaboration culture, continuous measurement, quality assurance, resilience, sharing, and transparency.
