#Abstract 
Microservices are the latest trend in software service design, development, and delivery. They constitute an approach to software and systems architecture that builds on the well-established concept of modularization but emphasizes technical boundaries. Each module—each microservice —is implemented and operated as a small yet independent system, offering access to its internal logic and data through a well-defined network interface. This increases software agility because each microservice becomes an independent unit of development, deployment, operations, versioning, and scaling.
